# About the project
This project was developped as part of my Algorithmic Techniques for AI course over the Fall 2023 semester along with my teammate.

The aim of this project was to create a path-finding AI that could use different search techniques to reach a destination on the map set by the user. The agent size can be changed. The agent can also only move on the same coloured tiles on the map. At any moment, it is not allowed to change tile colours. If the destination is on another coloured tile, then no path exist between the 2 points. The agent is also not allowed to slide diagonally if its corners jump on a different coloured tile while sliding. 

In the demo video, I go over the specifics of the code and some interesting 'tricks' I learnt while working on this project.
